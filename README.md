# V-Drive

This script will install a V: drive (using the SUBST command) that maps to the VICE Lab folder on box Drive.

Benefits:
  - Use Windows search on BoxDrive
  - Paths/links are consistent from one computer to the next 
  - V-drive can also mirror your V: drive to a profile on Remote Desktop (as long as you are connected):
      Just install V-Drive on the Remote Desktop profile as well, 
      and make sure you have shared your local V: drive using the Local Devices and Resources option in 
	  Microsoft Remote Desktop.
